# The first blog of this homesite.

This is the first blog of this homesite.

It takes me <HoverComment comment="about 7 days"> a few days </HoverComment> to publish this new homesite project.

It still needs some time to complete it. For example, there is some tasks I have not done:

1. RSS subscribe
2. Mastodon integration for my Post
3. Old blogs migration
4. ... and so on

I hope this project will be my `base project` or `base website`, which means
I can do some experiments or useful features on this website.

## Why I abandoned Hugo

Hugo is good, indeed. But I want to use
[mdx](https://mdxjs.com/)
as the main tool to write my blogs. Thus I can reuse a lot of components.
And I can customize my blog more handy.
