I bought a Pixelbook Go (2019) recently from xianyu and installed a Archlinux on it. Everything was ok but 2 only problems. There is no audio driver support and camera driver.

I thought there is no way to sovle them, but I found a very easy way to install the audio driver, which is this repo.

It is very simple to setup the audio driver: 

1. Clone the repo
2. execute the python script
3. reboot your device
