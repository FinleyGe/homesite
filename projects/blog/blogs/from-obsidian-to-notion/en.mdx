## Why do I give Obsidian up?

### 1. Markdown is not enough.

There is no question that markdown is a good tool to write some thing. But Is it enough for a all-in-one (including but not limiting GTD, To-do List, Journals) App? My Answer is no. 

### 2. Hard to sync my notes without paying a service

Although I have a server in my house, it is still a question that when my server is offline, how can I sync my notes.

I have tried many ways to sync my vaults.

1. Syncthing. A totally free software to sync anything.
    - But the question is I have to run this software any time. It will accelreate to drain my battery espacially my old phone. 
    - Another question is that I have no idea why the Syncthing could cause plenty of sync-conflict files, which make me mad.
2. Live Sync Plugin. It still need a server run a database service. My NAS could do this but when I go out and there is no roommate, I should poweroff my NAS for safety.

But If I use Notion. It is not a question. But there is one question appeared, which I can not access it when I have no Internet connected, although Notion still can work if I cached the notes when it is connected to the Internet.

## Why do I choose Notion?

### 1. It’s free and popular.

### 2. It’s good at integrating with Google Calendar

I am a user of Google and Google Calendar.

### 3. It's good at integrating with Markdown grammer.

Old habits die hard. I still want to write my notes in a markdown way.

## Is there any other options for me?

The answer is possibly yes. Feishu is also a good option for me to take the place of Obsidian. But it is too heavy for me. On the other hand, as a Chinese App, the internet access is better as the reason we all know. 

Maybe one day, I take the place of Notion with Feishu but not now.
