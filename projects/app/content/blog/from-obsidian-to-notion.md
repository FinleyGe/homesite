# 从 Obsidian 到 Notion

为什么我放弃了 Obsidian

## 1. Markdown 的不充分

毫无疑问的是 Markdown 是一个非常好的写作工具。但是它并不足以胜任一个 all-in-one 的工具（包括 TO-DO List, 日记， GTD 等等）。

## 2. 难以在没有付费的情况下进行同步

Although I have a server in my house, it is still a question that when my server is offline, how can I sync my notes.

But If I use Notion. It is not a question. But there is one question appeared, which I can not access it when I have no Internet connected, although Notion still can work if I cached the notes when it is connected to the Internet.

## Why do I choose Notion?

### 1. It’s free and popular.

### 2. It’s good at integrating with Google Calendar

I am a user of Google and Google Calendar.

### Is there any other options for me?

The answer is yes. Feishu is also a good option for me to take the place of Obsidian. But it is too heavy for me. On the other hand, as a Chinese App, the internet access is better as the reason we all know.

Maybe one day, I take the place of Notion with Feishu but not now.
